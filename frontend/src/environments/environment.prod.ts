// `.env.ts` is generated by the `npm run write:env` command
// `npm run write:env` exposes environment variables as JSON for any usage you might
// want, like displaying the version or getting extra config from your CI bot, etc.
// This is useful for granularity you might need beyond just the environment.
// Note that as usual, any environment variables you expose through it will end up in your
// bundle, and you should not use it for any sensitive information like passwords or keys.
// Update the write:env script in package.json to add additional variables to write to the .env.ts file.
